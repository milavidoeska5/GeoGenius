Title: Monastery of Saint Naum

The Monastery of Saint Naum (Macedonian: Манастир „Свети Наум“) is a Macedonian Orthodox monastery. It is named after the medieval Bulgarian writer and enlightener Saint Naum who founded it. The monastery is situated in North Macedonia, along Lake Ohrid, 29 kilometres (18 mi) south of the city of Ohrid, within the boundary of the village of Ljubaništa.
The Lake Ohrid area, including St Naum, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in North Macedonia.

History
The monastery was established in the Bulgarian Empire in 905 by St Naum of Ohrid himself. St Naum is also buried in the church.
Since the 16th century, a Greek school had functioned in the monastery. The monastery had close ties with the printing house of Moscopole, a former prosperous Aromanian city now in Albania. The area where the monastery of St Naum lies belonged to Albania from 1912 until June 28, 1925, when Zog of Albania ceded it to Yugoslavia as a result of negotiations between Albania and Yugoslavia and as a gesture of goodwill.

In the arts
Rebecca West devoted a chapter of Black Lamb and Grey Falcon to her visit to Sveti Naum, which occurred in 1937.
